  <title>Vacancy defect</title>

<body>
  <p>In crystallography, a vacancy is a type of point defect in a crystal. Crystals inherently possess imperfections, sometimes referred to as crystalline defects. A defect in which an atom, such as silicon, is missing from one of the lattice sites is known as a 'vacancy' defect. It is also known as a Schottky defect, although in ionic crystals the concepts are not identical.</p>
